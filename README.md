# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## To create a new Create-React-App application you need to install Node.js and run the following command: 
npx create-react-app my-app (yarn can also be used)

my-app is the name of the folder that holds your setup files, this can be changed to any desired name. 

The node_modules folder holds all the references to libraries and modules. Once you type npm install in the command promt all the node_modules that are mentioned within the Package-lock.JSON file will be installed. 

DON'T UPLOAD THE NODE_MODULES FOLDERS 
Because this folder can be very large, the packagelockjson will hold all the references to the modules and they can be automatically installed by running npm install in the folder directory. 
When a library or module contains bugs you can remove the package manually by running npm remove and the name of the package. You can also delete the whole node_modules folder and remove the specific reference from the packagelock.json. Then you can run npm install again and it will only reinstall the remaining modules in the packagelockjson. 

Phaser can be installed and deployed by itself. In these examples the Phaser games are rendered within a React application so you only have to start the React application by running npm start command after you've installed the node_modules by running npm install within the folder.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
